                    <br>I was born inside the coziest house as I must say, near the shore of 
                    Baranggay Big Tabinay, Puerto Galera, Oriental Mindoro. <br><br> The parents that brought me to this world
                    are not the perfect parents yet have provided for me until the end of my senior high school days. An ultra industrious
                    mother that sometimes even sacrifices her health due to overwork, Adelfa Marquez. A hard-working yet have some self problems
                    and self-issues father, Manolito Marquez. <br><br> I have three siblings namely Lloyd Ian Marquez (five years younger to me), 
                    Aldrin James Marquez (10 years younger to me), and the only girl Jammela Marquez (13 years younger to me). I think I can say 
                    that I have bonded with them properly before I moved from Puerto Galera to Batangas for college.

                I can remember that I really enjoyed being with many people, I talk to them as a child, I laughed with them. I enjoyed running under 
                the sun at the hot sand near the shore. <br><br> It was all just a memory now. <br><br> I don't really remember when it happened but 
                I suddenly changed. I began being afraid of talking to people. I became shy. I became a loner. I have always questioned my self, "What 
                is my purpose in life? Why am I living?" <br><br> Until now, sometimes, I ask myself those questions. However, I am contented at what 
                and who I have now. I am happy. I learned how to live life because of the people I've met as my life goes on. </p>

                <p class="recinfo">As of now, I am a college student at Batangas State University - Alangilan Campus. I am a 3rd-year Information Technology 
                    student Major in Service Management. I am currently boarding at a dormitory near the school which is conviniently five or less minutes in 
                    walking distance. <br><br> I am managing to build my responsibility since I am away from my family which is somewhat challenging but I think I will 
                    be able to get used to it. Also, I recently notice that I am little by little bit building confidence as time passes by since I am able to 
                    talk casually to my boardmates and to my new classmates. <br><br> I can say that I am satisfied as of now.
